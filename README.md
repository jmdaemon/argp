# Argpy

Argpy is a command line interface designer library created as an alternative to argparse, and inspired by GNU's Argp.
Argpy (pronounced arg-pie) offers more freedom to customize and build your command line interface over other alternatives.
Argpy is also more lightweight than other solutions and provides more sane/desired defaults.
